# gemini_bot_list
A github repo of my try to list ip-addresses of gemini bots and proxy's. On Github are more people who can contribute to it probably than on codeberg :)



This is a try to make a list of much gemini bots and proxy's by IP addresses. Feel free to do pull requests, since I don't know all bots. I actually don't know much bots yet..
